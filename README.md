# Interceptor Gradle Plugin

This gradle plugin is adopted from [Sentry Android Gradle Plugin](https://github.com/getsentry/sentry-android-gradle-plugin) 
which provides interceptor functionality using ASM bytecode manipulation framework (same technology used by Embrace, for example.)

Modification to the original plugin includes

- removing code this is not necessary for the interceptor functionality

The source plugin code base is based on MIT Licenese.
